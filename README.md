# psofctl
A work in progress of a SDN controller written in C.

This project involves a high performance and scalable multi-threaded SDN 
controller capable of hanlding multiple switch communication using OpenFlow. 
It is written with POSIX threads and sockets. The current goal will be to port 
it over to mininet and check overall functioning, after that, I will test 
its performance.

The project is currently in the process of thourough documenting before 
uploading it.

More to come...
